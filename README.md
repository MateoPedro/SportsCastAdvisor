# Sportscast Advisor: French Sports Broadcasting Recommendation System

Sportscast Advisor is a user-focused recommendation system designed to provide insights on the most cost-effective sports broadcasting options in France. It empowers users by helping them navigate the intricate landscape of sports broadcasting in the country.

France has a dynamic and complex sports broadcasting scene, with over 10 active broadcasters, all providing coverage for various sports competitions. Each broadcaster has its unique array of sports and competitions that it covers. Furthermore, the broadcasting rights for these competitions are continuously changing, making it quite challenging to keep track of which broadcaster covers which competition. 

## Project Overview

This project was built with two main objectives:

1. **Data Extraction**: Utilizing Scrapy, an open-source and collaborative web crawling framework, data was efficiently extracted from over 10 French sports networks' websites. This process assembled an extensive dataset containing each competition and its respective broadcasters. 

2. **Recommendation System Development**: Leveraging the power of Python and pandas, a data-driven recommendation system was developed specifically for the French market. This system allows users to identify the most cost-effective broadcaster for their desired sports competitions.

The ultimate goal of Sportscast Advisor is to provide users with personalized broadcaster recommendations based on their sports preferences, keeping in mind the constantly changing broadcasting rights and the need for cost-effective solutions. With this tool, fans of sports can enjoy their favorite competitions without worrying about navigating the complex broadcasting landscape.

## Future Work

As broadcasting rights keep changing, maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the dataset is crucial. Future updates to this project will aim to automate the data update process to ensure that users receive recommendations based on the most recent information.
